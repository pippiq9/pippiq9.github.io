		<strong>Why I Use Comic Sans</strong>
    </p>


    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        First of all, Comic Sans is what my voice sounds like.
        So that is the main reason I use it here, as I'm trying
        to give you a sense of what I'm like.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        Secondly: Comic Sans scoops up the origin of letter
        learning and reading out of the brains of a large
        swath of a generation. For those people, Comic Sans
        is probably going to be the easiest to read. Nothing
        can be accessible to everyone, but I believe Comic Sans
        is accessible to more people than other fonts. 
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        For those who don’t know, many elementary school
        students (including me) learned to write print
        letters by tracing large, typed-out letters on a
        sheet of printer paper with a grid — not in
        Comic Sans, but a similar font. I'm not sure how
        many people this speaks to, but at least at our
        school, in later elementary school, many teachers
        would use Comic Sans to indicate a “small” or “fun”
        assignment, not to be fretted too much over.
        For serious papers and tests, it was all about
        Times New Roman. Even in High School, if a teacher
        wanted to signal that something was low stakes,
        they’d often use Comic Sans on the handout.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        For me, it’s the kind of thing that automatically
        lowers my heart rate. And I hope it can do the same,
        at least for some people visiting this website.
        This is not to say I want to alienate or exclude
        people who did not grow up reading Comic Sans —
        it’s just not an objectively difficult font to read
        for people who didn’t. The only people I’d like to
        alienate are people who, after reading all of this,
        still think that Comic Sans is worthless. But my guess
        is that if that were you, you wouldn’t have even
        made it this far.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        I’d rather be dismissed as juvenile than feel elitist
        or inaccessible. I also want to be myself on my
        website, because I would love to normalize the practice
        of not having to pretend to be "super serious" in order
        to convince people that we are capable of doing things.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        I used to have a very "professional"
        website, but it made me seem like a jerk. That's not to say
        that all professional websites make people seem like jerks.
        Mine just did.
        The aesthetics of this whole website are very silly,
        because I am very silly. And I think that is an asset.
        We will see how it turns out. My jester's privilege
        may cost me jobs. If that seems to be happening
        maybe I will revert to
        something more streamlined and scary and less
        expressive, that has the express
        intention of impressing people.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px;">
        While I wish I didn't have to try and impress you, 
        depending on who you are, I might. And that puts us
        in a weird power dynamic where I cannot bring my whole
        self to the table. However, my hope is that bringing
        some of myself to this website models one sprout of
        self love and vulnerability
        that I hope we can all grow together. And if that
        is something that is important to you, maybe you
        feel like you'd want to work together. All font is
        performance, but you, lovely person, are my target
        audience, so I want to be real with you, whatever
        that means in the context of a website designed to
        advertise myself to "the world."
    </p>


    <p>If you read all of that, you're a very epic champion. If you didn't, you're still a champion.</p>
